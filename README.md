### What is CryptoDash?
CryptoDash is a crypto currency tracker that allows its users to have access to real time live and accurate data about any crypto currency coin available.
All data displayed on CryptoDash is fetched from the [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) API Free tier.

### Why did I build CryptoDash?
All in the name of becoming a good developerðŸ˜¤.</br>

CryptoDash is a project that allowed me to become comfortable with TypeScript in a React ecosystem while also exposing me to key concepts in state management, asynchronous data fetching, and integration with APIs. Working on CryptoDash helped me improve my understanding of TypeScript's type safety, particularly in defining props, handling complex data structures, and building reusable components in a way that minimizes errors. Additionally, this project introduced me to best practices in organizing React code, including component structure, hooks, and efficient rendering, making it a valuable learning experience in TypeScript and React development.
